            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>SecretR00M ("the App") is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect (and don't collect), how the App works, and your rights.</p>
            <p><strong>In summary: We don't collect your personal data, we can't read your messages, and we don't track your activity.</strong></p>

            <h2>No Account Required</h2>
            <p>SecretR00M does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, phone number, or any other personal information. You can use the App without identifying yourself.</p>

            <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>We do not collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>Message content</li>
                <li>Contact lists</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>End-to-End Encryption</h2>
            <p>All messages sent through CalculatorPR0 are protected by end-to-end encryption:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption happens on your device</strong> — Messages are encrypted before they leave your phone</li>
                <li><strong>Only participants can decrypt</strong> — Only people in the room have the keys to read messages</li>
                <li><strong>We cannot access content</strong> — We have no technical ability to read your encrypted messages</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Temporary Rooms</h2>
            <p>SecretR00M uses temporary rooms that exist only while participants are connected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rooms are created on-demand and exist only in memory</li>
                <li>When all participants leave or the host closes the room, it is permanently deleted</li>
                <li>Message history is not stored after a room ends</li>
                <li>We do not maintain logs of room activity or participants</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Processed On-Device</h2>
            <p>The following operations occur entirely on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption and decryption of messages</li>
                <li>Generation of encryption keys</li>
                <li>Display of messages and media</li>
                <li>App preferences and settings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data In Transit</h2>
            <p>When you use the App, the following data is transmitted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encrypted messages</strong> — Content is encrypted before transmission; only intended recipients can decrypt</li>
                <li><strong>Room coordination</strong> — Basic signals to establish and maintain room connections (e.g., join requests, participant status)</li>
                <li><strong>Invite tokens</strong> — One-time tokens to allow others to join rooms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All transmissions are encrypted in transit. We do not log or store the content of transmissions.</p>

            <h2>Local Storage</h2>
            <p>The App may store the following locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>App preferences and settings</li>
                <li>Optional privacy lock passcode (stored securely in device Keychain)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>

            <h2>No Tracking or Analytics</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2>No Advertising</h2>
            <p>The App does not display advertisements and does not share any data with advertising networks.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>SecretR00M does not integrate with third-party services that collect user data. The App operates independently without external analytics, social media integrations, or advertising platforms.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>SecretR00M is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. Since the App does not collect personal information, there is no data to remove.</p>
