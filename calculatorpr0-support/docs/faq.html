            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I create a room?</h3>
                <p>Tap the "Create Room" button on the home screen. A new secure room will be created, and you'll receive a unique room ID and invite link that you can share with others.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I join a room?</h3>
                <p>You can join a room in two ways: (1) Tap on an invite link shared with you, or (2) Enter the room ID manually using the "Join Room" button. The room host will need to approve your request to join.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
                <p>No. CalculatorPR0 does not require any account registration, email, or phone number. You can start using the app immediately.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Invites and Sharing</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I invite someone to my room?</h3>
                <p>Once you've created a room, tap the "Invite" button to generate a shareable link. You can send this link through any messaging app, email, or share it directly. The link is valid for 24 hours and can only be used once.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why did my invite link expire?</h3>
                <p>Invite links expire after 24 hours for security reasons. They can also only be used once. If your link has expired or been used, simply generate a new one from within the room.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is my join request pending?</h3>
                <p>For security, all join requests must be approved by the room host. Your request will remain pending until the host approves or denies it. Make sure the host knows to expect your request.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Connection and Connectivity</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is the connection taking a long time?</h3>
                <p>CalculatorPR0 uses a secure connection that may take a moment to establish, especially on slower networks. The app will show connection progress. If it takes longer than usual, try checking your internet connection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What does "Secure: Connecting" mean?</h3>
                <p>This status indicates the app is establishing a secure connection. Wait for it to show "Secure: Connected" before creating or joining rooms. This process protects your privacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why did I get disconnected?</h3>
                <p>Disconnections can occur due to network issues, the host closing the room, or the app being sent to the background. For security, rooms close automatically when the app is backgrounded or the device is locked.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use the app on cellular data?</h3>
                <p>Yes. CalculatorPR0 works on both Wi-Fi and cellular data. However, a stable connection is recommended for the best experience.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Rooms and Messages</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long do rooms last?</h3>
                <p>Rooms exist only while participants are actively connected. Once all participants leave or the host closes the room, it is permanently deleted along with all messages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I recover deleted messages?</h3>
                <p>No. Messages are not stored anywhere after they are deleted or after a room ends. This is by design to protect your privacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What types of content can I share?</h3>
                <p>You can share text messages, images, and videos. All content is encrypted end-to-end before being sent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens when I leave a room?</h3>
                <p>When you leave a room, you will no longer receive messages from that room. If you were the host, the room will be closed for all participants.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are my messages encrypted?</h3>
                <p>Yes. All messages are protected with end-to-end encryption. Messages are encrypted on your device before being sent, and only participants in the room can decrypt them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you read my messages?</h3>
                <p>No. Due to end-to-end encryption, we cannot read the contents of your messages. Only participants in the room have access.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why does the app close when I switch apps?</h3>
                <p>For security, CalculatorPR0 closes active rooms when the app goes to the background or the device is locked. This ensures your conversations remain protected.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What data do you collect?</h3>
                <p>We do not collect personal data, message content, or usage analytics. Please see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for complete details.</p>

            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>The app won't connect</h3>
                <p>Try these steps: (1) Check your internet connection, (2) Close and reopen the app, (3) Ensure you're not on a restricted network (some corporate/school networks may block certain connections).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I can't join a room</h3>
                <p>Make sure: (1) The room still exists (the host hasn't closed it), (2) Your invite link hasn't expired, (3) The host is online to approve your request.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Messages aren't sending</h3>
                <p>Verify that you're connected (status shows "Secure: Connected") and that you're still in an active room. If issues persist, try leaving and rejoining the room.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>The app crashed or closed unexpectedly</h3>
                <p>If the app closes unexpectedly, simply reopen it. Note that any active rooms will be closed, and you'll need to create or join a new room.</p>
